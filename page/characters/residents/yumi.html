			<p>
				Yumi naturally has long wavy magenta hair that flows down through her shoulders. She has alluring black
				eyes that can be perceived as different shades of violet depending on the intensity of light. Underneath
				her left eye lies a small beauty mark. She also has violet ears with fluffy white tufts and a semi-deep
				cut on the lower back right side, caused by an incident during her childhood. Yumi has a semi-athletic
				build but appears more slender with soft curves wrapping around her body. Her tail is violet with a
				fluffy white tip.

			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Yumi prefers form-fitting shapewear and has an affinity for ribbons, lace, jewelry, and floral textures.
				Her main color palette consists of neighboring hues of purple, including, but not limited to lavender,
				amethyst, violet, indigo, magenta, and pink. She has accents of black, grey, and white. Most of her
				outfits consist of a choker, ribbon, pendant, body chain, rings, stockings, and high heels. She prefers
				skirts over shorts and wears dresses during formal events. During her time as a model, she's been
				recognized for her summer swimwear and intimates photoshoots.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Her initial design sported a corset dress exposing her cleavage, shoulders, upper back, and thighs. It
				donned thigh-high fishnet stockings and a heart-shaped multi-gemmed pendant attached to a lace
				choker/vest top. On the back of her dress rests interlacing white satin laces.

			<p>
				<b>Prologue</b>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Yumi was born on November 18th, but her birth year is currently unknown. She has no recollection of her
				childhood, and the only thing she can recall is a vague memory of when she first received her pendant,
				which she's been wearing for most of her lifetime.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				As a teenager, she dreamt of being a model exhibiting her original designs. The very idea of being able
				to showcase her creative talent while working on her self-confidence as well as meeting people from
				diverse backgrounds motivated her. In an attempt to make this a reality, she began to devote the vast
				majority of her time to prioritizing her appearance by engaging in activities such as yoga and swimming,
				while also learning to maintain a proper diet. She found herself enjoying a variety of different
				cuisines, but the taste of fresh fish and berries appealed to her the most.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				In addition to her appearance, she spent a considerable amount of time studying photography and design,
				providing her with a well-rounded fashion sense. She took to social media and started posting pinups of
				herself taken by a close friend hoping to extend her reach as a public influencer. In the beginning, she
				borrowed outfits from a local tailor, mainly dresses with hand-crafted accessories. When she matured,
				she shifted to lingerie and swimwear, which attracted several well-known modeling agencies, though none
				that she had any interest in nor signed contracts with due to misaligned ideals.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Chapter 1 - A New Opportunity</b>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				One evening, while lying in bed, she received a message from a new and upcoming agency that briefly
				mentioned a last-minute opportunity for her to participate in a royal-inspired lingerie line scheduled
				for the following week. She was excited for the opportunity so the next morning she visited the salon to
				have her hair done. She spent the next few days preparing her portfolio and practicing her runway walk.
				A day before the interview, she decided to visit the venue, thinking it'd be nice to check out the area.
				While on the way, she passed through an alley where her pendant started to glow. Disregarding the
				unusual occurrence, she proceeded to her destination.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				A few moments before arriving at her destination, Yumi sensed a few women following her. Out of
				precaution, she decided to turn back and headed toward a café she walked by earlier. When she stepped
				into the shop, she realized the barista had a similar insignia on her outfit to the women who followed
				her previously. To avoid raising suspicion, she nonchalantly asked for the powder room and was directed
				toward the back. When the women entered the café, they discussed with the barista who pointed them in
				her direction. Noticing the women closing in on her, she slowly walked toward the powder room and found
				an additional door leading to the back exit of the café.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Yumi quickly exited the establishment and blocked the exit with nearby debris, wood palettes from the
				pastries sold by the café, hoping to delay the women pursuing her, but still felt extremely anxious
				knowing that at any moment, they would find her. As she took a moment to collect her thoughts, her
				pendant started to resume its unusual behavior. She realized that she was in the very same alley where
				she experienced the strange occurrence earlier. Suddenly, a wisp of light emerged from her pendant and
				vanished into a slight opening in the wall. Her eyes began to turn violet and she felt an instinct to
				claw open the mysterious opening, which resulted in a portal fully materializing in front of her. She
				glanced toward the sealed door. The women had nearly broken past the blockade. She considered making a
				run for it toward the end of the alley, but as she headed toward the street, the barista appeared.
				Frantically, she decided to take her chances and scurried through the portal. When she reached the other
				side, the portal immediately vanished behind her, leaving no way to return.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				<b>Chapter 2 - A Mysterious Place</b>
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				She found herself at the gates of an unknown estate. The time of day was different. It was sunset. The
				air was a calm breeze that flowed through her hair. Grasping her pendant closely, Yumi felt relieved and
				almost a sense of familiarity with this place. As she approached the gates, they slowly began to swing
				open, exposing the exterior of a grandiose estate. She entered the gates to find a nearby bench in front
				of a running stone fountain. Yumi took the time to sit and clear her mind looking at her reflection
				through the fountain waters. She started to wonder what just happened. Who were the women that chased
				her? Why did they follow her? How did she get here? It all seemed so strange.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Not knowing what would happen next, she then turned her head toward the property. Its walls were
				exquisite as if it were just recently constructed, yet the architecture resembled that of a different
				era. She thought to herself, "I wonder who lives here" and out of the corner of her eye, she spotted
				movement in one of the windows. She cautiously approached the front doors and looked back toward the
				gates before entering. There was nowhere to go. The portal no longer exists and there were no
				alternative options to return home. She took a deep breath and proceeded to enter the building, shutting
				the doors behind her.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				It was dark. She could barely see anything other than what seemed to be a front desk and a bell through
				a bleeding light from the front windows, perhaps to alert the owner of someone's presence. The pendant
				started to glow again, illuminating only a short distance around her. When she took her first step
				toward the desk, the pendant stopped shining and a small entity appeared from within. It was bright; its
				colors resembled fluorescent lights. The entity flew around the room, revealing lavish stairs, multiple
				elevators, and several locked doors. At the end of its path, the entity flew toward the bell, causing a
				gentle ring throughout the room. Moments later, pure silence. An overhang chandelier descended,
				irradiating the entire room. Yumi was in awe, unsure of what to do next. She was standing in the foyer
				of a magnificent mansion.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				The entity, possibly a spirit, traveled toward the right of the foyer and turned a corner, leaving her
				field of view. A light from that direction shined, prompting her to explore more of the mansion. She
				approached the light and wound up at the entrance of another room. To Yumi's surprise, the room itself
				was nearly empty. Though solid, the walls were deconstructed, floors exposing the ground's foundation
				layer, and an opening in the ground extending upwards above the ceiling where a breeze could be felt.
				Soon after, the spirit appeared, startling Yumi. It turned toward the room and the structures began to
				change.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Stone floor tiles appeared to place themselves one tile at a time. The walls decorated themselves in
				deep lavender paint with subtle textures, ornate crown molding, and wainscoting. Looking up, the
				ceilings were then lined with multi-patterned arches. Beautiful flowers alongside a green façade bloomed
				around the room. Large windows appeared on the back walls, revealing a pathway down to a great botanical
				garden. A queen-sized mattress with silk sheets and gold-trimmed Chesterfield headboard, ottoman,
				bookshelves, and dresser furnished the room above a well-placed rug. The room finally stabilized and the
				spirit returned to Yumi's pendant.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Atop the left bedside drawer was an old box, which stood out amongst the sight of the extravagant room.
				She stepped towards the box and found only two objects within. The first is an elegantly crafted purple
				room key, matching the style of the newly constructed architecture which Yumi decided to keep within her
				possession. The second is an old photograph of what looks to be her childhood self and the lower half of
				a mysterious woman in a beautiful black dress. Even though she felt a sense of nostalgia rushing through
				her, she had no memory of where the photo was taken.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				After placing the photo back in the box, Yumi glanced at the open space in the ground from earlier. An
				elevator formed in its place. She examined the elevator but found it to be inoperable. Attached to the
				hinge was a note addressed to Yumi. It read, "We're delighted to have you back. You will find that all
				amenities will be provided exactly as you envision them. Please enjoy your stay! PS: This elevator is
				currently not in service. Please use the elevators in the foyer as they are fully operational."
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Feeling overwhelmed, Yumi retrieved the note and placed it by her bedside. She closed the door to the
				room and then prepared to retire for the night. There was more to learn about the manor, but it could
				wait. She laid her head down on the soft pillows and proceeded to fall asleep.
