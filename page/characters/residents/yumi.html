			<p>
				Yumi naturally has long wavy magenta hair that flows down through her shoulders. She has alluring black
				eyes that can be perceived as different shades of violet depending on the intensity of light. Underneath
				her left eye lies a small beauty mark. She also has violet ears with fluffy white tufts and a semi-deep
				cut on the lower back right side, caused by an incident during her childhood. Yumi has a semi-athletic
				build but appears more slender with soft curves wrapping around her body. Her tail is violet with a
				fluffy white tip.

			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Yumi prefers form-fitting shapewear and has an affinity for ribbons, lace, jewelry, and floral textures.
				Her main color palette consists of neighboring hues of purple, including, but not limited to lavender,
				amethyst, violet, indigo, magenta, and pink. She has accents of black, grey, and white. Most of her
				outfits consist of a choker, ribbon, pendant, body chain, rings, stockings, and high heels. She prefers
				skirts over shorts and wears dresses during formal events. During her time as a model, she's been
				recognized for her summer swimwear and intimates photoshoots.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				Her initial design sported a corset dress exposing her cleavage, shoulders, upper back, and thighs. It
				donned thigh-high fishnet stockings and a heart-shaped multi-gemmed pendant attached to a lace
				choker/vest top. On the back of her dress rests interlacing white satin laces.

					<h2 class="header2">Driven By Ambition</h2>
					<p>
						Yumi was born on November 18th, but her birth year is currently unknown. She has no recollection
						of her childhood, and the only thing she can recall is a vague memory of when she first received
						her pendant, which she's been wearing for most of her lifetime.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						As a teenager, she dreamt of being a model exhibiting her original designs. The very idea of
						being able to showcase her creative talent while working on her self-confidence as well as
						meeting people from diverse backgrounds motivated her. In an attempt to make this a reality, she
						began to devote the vast majority of her time to prioritizing her appearance by engaging in
						activities such as yoga and swimming, while also learning to maintain a proper diet. She found
						herself enjoying a variety of different cuisines, but the taste of fresh fish and berries
						appealed to her the most.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						In addition to her appearance, she spent a considerable amount of time studying photography and
						design, providing her with a well-rounded fashion sense. She took to social media and started
						posting pinups of herself taken by a close friend hoping to extend her reach as a public
						influencer. In the beginning, she borrowed outfits from a local tailor, mainly dresses with
						hand-crafted accessories. When she matured, she shifted to lingerie and swimwear, which
						attracted several well-known modeling agencies, though none that she had any interest in nor
						signed contracts with due to misaligned ideals.
					</p>
					<br>
				</div>
				<div id="Chapter1" class="tab">
					<br>
					<h2 class="header2">A New Opportunity</h2>
					<p>
						One evening, while lying in bed, she received a message from a new and upcoming agency that
						briefly mentioned a last-minute opportunity for her to participate in a royal-inspired lingerie
						line scheduled for the following week. She was excited for the opportunity so the next morning
						she visited the salon to have her hair done. She spent the next few days preparing her portfolio
						and practicing her runway walk. A day before the interview, she decided to visit the venue,
						thinking it'd be nice to check out the area. While on the way, she passed through an alley where
						her pendant started to glow. Disregarding the unusual occurrence, she proceeded to her
						destination.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						A few moments before arriving at her destination, Yumi sensed a few women following her. Out of
						precaution, she decided to turn back and headed toward a café she walked by earlier. When she
						stepped into the shop, she realized the barista had a similar insignia on her outfit to the
						women who followed her previously. To avoid raising suspicion, she nonchalantly asked for the
						powder room and was directed toward the back. When the women entered the café, they discussed
						with the barista who pointed them in her direction. Noticing the women closing in on her, she
						slowly walked toward the powder room and found an additional door leading to the back exit of
						the café.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Yumi quickly exited the establishment and blocked the exit with nearby debris, wood palettes
						from the pastries sold by the café, hoping to delay the women pursuing her, but still felt
						extremely anxious knowing that at any moment, they would find her. As she took a moment to
						collect her thoughts, her pendant started to resume its unusual behavior. She realized that she
						was in the very same alley where she experienced the strange occurrence earlier. Suddenly, a
						wisp of light emerged from her pendant and vanished into a slight opening in the wall. Her eyes
						began to turn violet and she felt an instinct to claw open the mysterious opening, which
						resulted in a portal fully materializing in front of her. She glanced toward the sealed door.
						The women had nearly broken past the blockade. She considered making a run for it toward the end
						of the alley, but as she headed toward the street, the barista appeared. Frantically, she
						decided to take her chances and scurried through the portal. When she reached the other side,
						the portal immediately vanished behind her, leaving no way to return.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div id="Chapter2" class="tab">
					<br>
					<h2 class="header2">The Mysterious Place</h2>
					<p>
						She found herself at the gates of an unknown estate. The time of day was different. It was
						sunset. The air was a calm breeze that flowed through her hair. Grasping her pendant closely,
						Yumi felt relieved and almost a sense of familiarity with this place. As she approached the
						gates, they slowly began to swing open, exposing the exterior of a grandiose estate. She entered
						the gates to find a nearby bench in front of a running stone fountain. Yumi took the time to sit
						and clear her mind looking at her reflection through the fountain waters. She started to wonder
						what just happened. Who were the women that chased her? Why did they follow her? How did she get
						here? It all seemed so strange.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Not knowing what would happen next, she then turned her head toward the property. Its walls were
						exquisite as if it were just recently constructed, yet the architecture resembled that of a
						different era. She thought to herself, "I wonder who lives here" and out of the corner of her
						eye, she spotted movement in one of the windows. She cautiously approached the front doors and
						looked back toward the gates before entering. There was nowhere to go. The portal no longer
						exists and there were no alternative options to return home. She took a deep breath and
						proceeded to enter the building, shutting the doors behind her.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						It was dark. She could barely see anything other than what seemed to be a front desk and a bell
						through a bleeding light from the front windows, perhaps to alert the owner of someone's
						presence. The pendant started to glow again, illuminating only a short distance around her. When
						she took her first step toward the desk, the pendant stopped shining and a small entity appeared
						from within. It was bright; its colors resembled fluorescent lights. The entity flew around the
						room, revealing lavish stairs, multiple elevators, and several locked doors. At the end of its
						path, the entity flew toward the bell, causing a gentle ring throughout the room. Moments later,
						pure silence. An overhang chandelier descended, irradiating the entire room. Yumi was in awe,
						unsure of what to do next. She was standing in the foyer of a magnificent mansion.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The entity, possibly a spirit, traveled toward the right of the foyer and turned a corner,
						leaving her field of view. A light from that direction shined, prompting her to explore more of
						the mansion. She approached the light and wound up at the entrance of another room. To Yumi's
						surprise, the room itself was nearly empty. Though solid, the walls were deconstructed, floors
						exposing the ground's foundation layer, and an opening in the ground extending upwards above the
						ceiling where a breeze could be felt. Soon after, the spirit appeared, startling Yumi. It turned
						toward the room and the structures began to change.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Stone floor tiles appeared to place themselves one tile at a time. The walls decorated
						themselves in deep lavender paint with subtle textures, ornate crown molding, and wainscoting.
						Looking up, the ceilings were then lined with multi-patterned arches. Beautiful flowers
						alongside a green façade bloomed around the room. Large windows appeared on the back walls,
						revealing a pathway down to a great botanical garden. A queen-sized mattress with silk sheets
						and gold-trimmed Chesterfield headboard, ottoman, bookshelves, and dresser furnished the room
						above a well-placed rug. The room finally stabilized and the spirit returned to Yumi's pendant.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Atop the left bedside drawer was an old box, which stood out amongst the sight of the
						extravagant room. She stepped towards the box and found only two objects within. The first is an
						elegantly crafted purple room key, matching the style of the newly constructed architecture
						which Yumi decided to keep within her possession. The second is an old photograph of what looks
						to be her childhood self and the lower half of a mysterious woman in a beautiful black dress.
						Even though she felt a sense of nostalgia rushing through her, she had no memory of where the
						photo was taken.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						After placing the photo back in the box, Yumi glanced at the open space in the ground from
						earlier. An elevator formed in its place. She examined the elevator but found it to be
						inoperable. Attached to the hinge was a note addressed to Yumi. It read, "We're delighted to
						have you back. You will find that all amenities will be provided exactly as you envision them.
						Please enjoy your stay! PS: This elevator is currently not in service. Please use the elevators
						in the foyer as they are fully operational."
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Feeling overwhelmed, Yumi retrieved the note and placed it by her bedside. She closed the door
						to the room and then prepared to retire for the night. There was more to learn about the manor,
						but it could wait. She laid her head down on the soft pillows and proceeded to fall asleep.

							<b>Author's Note:</b> The following chapter introduces fragments of Yumi's past in

					</p>
					<br>
					<h2 class="header2">Distant Memories</h2>
					<h3>Sunset Fields</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Sunset -- the time of day before the town illuminates and when many workers retire after a
						fulfilling day at work. The sound of footsteps, casual chatter, and birds chirping fills the
						air. Travelers from distant settlements gather in the town square for a chance to converse about
						stories from their past or participate in trades.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Beyond the view of the rustic structures exists a path leading to an open field with dewy grass
						and patches of periwinkle flowers. A child sits, unbothered by her dampened dress, in the field
						next to a basket partially filled. In her lap, rests a stem with bright green leaves on both
						sides. She holds in the palm of her hands petals from a flower she's recently picked and brings
						them close to her face. The soft floral scent makes her smile, reminding her of a place she
						knew. She places the stem and flowers into the basket and looks up into the sky. An ombré of
						colors ranging from orange and yellow to indigo and violet pass through the clouds creating a
						remarkable sight. Stars have already began to faintly appear, signaling it's time for her to
						return home. She gets up from the ground, picking up the basket beside her, and happily skips
						along the path away from the town.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Crystal Garden</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Along the path she encounters a lavish garden full of potted floral arrangements and trimmed
						bushes, enclosed by strong, dark wood trees. The flowers lie reposed, with their buds in the
						process of transitioning to their closed state for the evening. Along one side was a line of
						newly planted seeds and on the other a nearly empty pot atop a dimly lit wooden table. Curious,
						she walked towards the table and examined the pot. There was no soil, only glistening stones
						that contrasted the color of the flowers stored in her basket. She reaches for her basket and
						retrieves the apetalous stem from earlier.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Looking back towards the path, she notices a young woman entering the garden from an alternative
						entrance. The woman greets and approaches her with a light smile, carefully taking steps over
						the loose gravel. Without saying a word, she then gently takes the little girl's hands and
						guides her to dig a small crevice in the pot of stones to plant the stem. She wraps the stones
						around the stem to hold it firmly in place. Petals start to emerge from the tip of the stem,
						forming a new bulb. The little girl glanced at the flower, and as the flower bloomed, it
						revealed an iridescent crystal. At a loss for words from witnessing the immediate growth, she
						takes a moment to process the experience.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						The woman gracefully reaches for the crystal and attaches it to a pendant she removes from her
						own neck, perfectly filling an open socket. The little girl closes her eyes as the woman wraps
						the pendant around her neck. Its colors begin to shift, from clear to variations of amethyst to
						violet before settling on a singular hue. The little girl feels warmth, as though the pendant
						filled a missing part of her spirit and takes a deep breath. When she opened her eyes, she
						realized that the woman had already exited the garden. Confused, she then headed along the path
						to find her way home.
					</p>
					<br>
					<h3>Home</h3>
					<br>
					<p>
						Ample time had passed since she left the garden. The sky had dark and the moons had risen
						clearly above the horizon. When she arrived at her home, the front door had been left open, with
						the lights glaring outwards revealing particles in the air. She notices at her feet a singular
						key. It doesn't look particularly useful, but she picks it up anyway. She walks around the home,
						the sound of wood floors buckling with each step. With each room, she turned on the lights to
						see if anything had changed since the last time she'd been there.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>Nothing seems out of place throughout the entirety of the first floor. She returns to the front
						door and fastens the locks. Following the steps up to the second floor, she walks into her small
						bedroom. The room is tidy, the bed is already made and the floors are clean. There were drawings
						and a large box of crayons sitting on a small table. She walks forward in the dark and takes a
						look at the drawing when she hears an unusual sound beneath her. It came from underneath the
						table so she lowers herself towards the ground and searches for the source.
					</p>
					<br>
					<p>
						Another near-inaudible noise reveals a small black kitten. The kitten looks at her and mews
						softly, brushing itself around the little girl's legs, causing her to accidentally drop the key
						she found earlier. Startled by the sudden movement, the kitten instictively pounces for the key,
						grabbing it in its mouth and scurries off into the next room. The little girl scrambles to catch
						up, but it is too late. She watches as the kitten jumps out of an open window and heads off into
						the darkness.
