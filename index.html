			<p>Existing beyond the veil of time and space, the Manor stands as a sanctuary — a living, breathing nexus
				where stories, memories, and spirits converge. Here, residents from countless worlds find refuge,
				renewal, and the chance to rediscover themselves through reflection and connection.</p>

			<p>Guided by Yumi, the Manor’s recently adopted hostess, the Manor exists not merely as a place of residence
				but as a vibrant community shaped by its inhabitants' dreams, histories, and spirits. Whether you are a
				traveler seeking solace, a creator eager to contribute, or a resident forging your path, the Manor is
				your home to explore, grow, and belong.</p>
