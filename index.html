      <h2 class="header1">Welcome to the Manor</h2>
      <p>Existing beyond the veil of time and space, the Manor stands as a sanctuary — a living, breathing nexus where stories, memories, and spirits converge. Here, residents from countless worlds find refuge, renewal, and the chance to rediscover themselves through reflection and connection.</p>
      <p>Guided by Yumi, the Manor’s recently adopted hostess, the Manor exists not merely as a place of residence but as a vibrant community shaped by its inhabitants' dreams, histories, and spirits. Whether you are a traveler seeking solace, a creator eager to contribute, or a resident forging your path, the Manor is your home to explore, grow, and belong.</p>

      <h2 class="header1">The Rules of the Manor</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Respect the Community:</b> Every resident’s story, spirit, and journey is valued. Disrespect, discrimination, or disruption will not be tolerated.</li>

        <li><b>Do Not Disturb Dormant Spirits:</b> Some spirits or memories remain dormant until their moment arrives. Attempts to prematurely awaken or force interaction are discouraged.</li>
        <li><b>Follow the Key System:</b> Room assignments and access are carefully managed by Yumi. Residents must respect assigned spaces.</li>
        <li><b>Collaborate Thoughtfully:</b> Contributions to the Manor’s lore or residents should respect established character arcs and world-building rules.</li>
        <li><b>Honor the Crystalization Process:</b> Crystals and memorabilia symbolize deep personal growth. Avoid altering or trivializing their significance.</li>
        <li><b>Embrace Emotional Maturity:</b> Conflicts are to be resolved with empathy and calm — the Manor fosters healing, not chaos.</li>
        <li><b>Share Only What’s Allowed:</b> Contributors should only reveal information pertinent to their own characters or approved storylines.</li>
